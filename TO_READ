To link microfront of React and Angular using single-SPA while everything is in different Docker containers, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new single-spa application using the CLI command `npx create-single-spa`. You can choose any framework you want to use, such as React or Angular.

2. Create a new Docker container for each microfrontend application that you want to use.

3. In each Docker container, install the single-spa library using `npm install single-spa`.

4. In each microfrontend application, create a new file called `root-application.js`. This file will be used to bootstrap your application.

5. In your root-application.js file, import the single-spa library and register your application using the following code:

```javascript
import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';

registerApplication({
  name: 'my-app',
  app: () => System.import('my-app'),
  activeWhen: ['/'],
});

start();
```

6. In your Docker container for each microfrontend application, add a new script to your package.json file that will start your application using single-spa:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./root-application.js"
}
```

7. Finally, start all of your Docker containers using Docker Compose.

This should allow you to link your microfrontends of React and Angular using single-SPA while everything is in different Docker containers.

perplexity : 
Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to link microfrontends of React and Angular using single-spa while everything is in different Docker containers:
1. Create a new single-spa application by running the following command:
npx create-single-spa
2. Follow the prompts to generate a single-spa application using your preferred framework.
3. Once the application is created, navigate into the newly created application folder.
4. In the root directory of your application, create a new file called root-application.js. This file will be the entry point for your microfrontends.
5. In root-application.js, import single-spa and define your microfrontends as follows:
import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';
registerApplication(
  'react',
  () => import('http://localhost:3000/single-spa.js'),
  pathPrefix('/react')
);
registerApplication(
  'angular',
  () => import('http://localhost:4200/main.js'),
  pathPrefix('/angular')
);
start();
6. In the above code, we have registered two microfrontends: react and angular. The first argument is the name of the microfrontend, the second argument is a function that returns the import statement for the microfrontend, and the third argument is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the microfrontend should be active based on the current URL.
7. Create a new Docker container for each microfrontend.
8. In each Docker container, add the following lines to the Dockerfile to expose the microfrontend on a specific port:
EXPOSE 3000 # for React
EXPOSE 4200 # for Angular
9. Build the Docker images for each microfrontend by running the following commands:
docker build -t react-app .
docker build -t angular-app .
10. Run the Docker containers for each microfrontend by running the following commands:
docker run -p 3000:3000 react-app
docker run -p 4200:4200 angular-app
11. Your microfrontends should now be running in separate Docker containers.
12. Update the URLs in root-application.js to point to the Docker containers:
import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';
registerApplication(
  'react',
  () => import('http://localhost:3000/single-spa.js'),
  pathPrefix('/react')
);
registerApplication(
  'angular',
  () => import('http://localhost:4200/main.js'),
  pathPrefix('/angular')
);
start();
13. Run your application using the following command:
npm start
14. Your microfrontends of React and Angular should now be linked using single-spa and running in separate Docker containers!
