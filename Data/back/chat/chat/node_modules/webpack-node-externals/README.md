Webpack allows you to define [*externals*](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals) - modules that should not be bundled.

When bundling with Webpack for the backend - you usually don't want to bundle its `node_modules` dependencies.
This library creates an *externals* function that ignores `node_modules` when bundling in Webpack.<br/>(Inspired by the great [Backend apps with Webpack](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-I) series)

## Quick usage
```sh
npm install webpack-node-externa
